title: "Adding Header Links to your Website"
---

If you add multiple pages to your website, you'll probably want to include links to them. The simplest way to do this is to use markdown links:

```markdown
[About Me](about.md) [Publications](publications.md) [CV](cv.pdf)
```

You can also use HTML buttons, like this:

```
<button>[About Me](about.md)</button> <button>[Publications](publications.md)</button> <button>[CV](cv.pdf)</button>
```

Whichever method you choose, you'll want to add the same links to the top of each page in your website.
